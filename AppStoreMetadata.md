## App Review Notes

**HealthKit Usage:**
Pixel Pace reads step count data from HealthKit to determine the character's energy state (vital/neutral/low). This is the core mechanic of the app - the character's appearance reflects the user's daily movement.

**Live Activity:**
The app uses Live Activities to display the pixel character on the Lock Screen and Dynamic Island. The character animates between 2 frames locally. Live Activity content updates when step count changes significantly (not continuously).

**Demo Instructions:**
1. Launch app and complete onboarding (select gender)
2. Grant HealthKit permission when prompted
3. Tap "Start Pixel Pace" to begin Live Activity
4. Character appears on Lock Screen and Dynamic Island
5. Walk to see character energy change
