> Goal: Downloads → Active Users → Phase 2 Evolution → Paywall → Subscriptions
> Timeline: 8 weeks to 1,000 downloads

## Platform Setup (Do This First — Day 1-2)

### Create These Accounts NOW

| Platform | Handle | Priority | Why |
|----------|--------|----------|-----|
| Instagram | @officialpixelpace (done) | Must have | Visual platform, perfect for pixel art |
| TikTok | @pixelpace | Must have | Best organic reach for new accounts, algorithm doesn't care about follower count |
| Reddit | u/pixelpace_app | Must have | Indie app communities are incredibly supportive and drive real downloads |
| X/Twitter | @pixelpaceapp | Nice to have | #buildinpublic community, indie dev support network |
| Product Hunt | Pixel Pace listing | Must have | One-time launch event, can drive 500+ downloads in a day |

**Skip for now:** YouTube, Facebook, Threads, LinkedIn. Spread too thin = nothing works.

### Account Setup Checklist

**All platforms:**
- Same profile photo everywhere (your most evolved pixel pal on bold background)
- Same bio structure: what it is + value prop + App Store link
- Link to App Store everywhere

**Instagram bio:**
```
Walk more. Level up your Pixel Pal.
Your steps evolve a pixel companion on your Lock Screen
Free on iPhone ⬇️
[App Store link]
```

**TikTok bio:**
```
Your steps bring a pixel pal to life 🎮
Free on iPhone — link below
```

**Reddit:** Don't put the app link in your bio yet. Participate genuinely first.

**X/Twitter bio:**
```
Building Pixel Pace — a step tracker where your pixel character evolves as you walk. Solo indie dev. #buildinpublic
```

## The Subscription Funnel (How Downloads Become Revenue)

Understanding this funnel shapes every piece of content:

```
See content → Visit profile → Click App Store link → Download (free)
→ Walk → Hit 25K weekly steps → Evolve to Phase 2 → See paywall
→ "I want Phase 3 & 4" → Subscribe ($2.99/mo or $19.99/yr)
```

**Critical insight:** The paywall triggers at Phase 2 graduation. Users need to:
1. Download the app
2. Actually use it for a week (retention)
3. Walk enough to hit Phase 2 (engagement)
4. Want to keep evolving (emotional investment in their pixel pal)

**This means:** Your content needs to make people emotionally attached to the character BEFORE they download. Show the evolution journey. Make them WANT to see their pal evolve. The subscription sells itself once they care about the character.

## Pre-Launch Phase (Days 1-7) — Build the Foundation

### Day 1-2: Platform Setup + Content Batch

**Create accounts** on all platforms listed above.

**Batch-create your first 12 Instagram posts:**
1. Introduction Reel: "Meet Pixel Pace" — show the character, what the app does (15 sec)
2. Evolution carousel: All 4 phases explained with character art
3. Reel: Screen recording of Live Activity on Lock Screen with chill lo-fi audio
4. Static: Your pixel pal character art with "Coming to your Lock Screen"
5. Carousel: "Why walking is the most underrated exercise" (5 health facts)
6. Reel: "POV: Your pixel pal watching you take the stairs" (humor)
7. Static: App screenshot — step counter UI
8. Carousel: "How Pixel Pace works" — step by step guide
9. Reel: Pixel art creation time-lapse (behind the scenes)
10. Static: Lock Screen + Dynamic Island screenshot
11. Reel: "What 2,500 vs 7,500 vs 10,000 steps looks like" with character states
12. Carousel: "Your Pixel Pal Evolution Guide" — the 4 phases + what unlocks each

**Adapt 5 of these for TikTok** (the Reels translate directly).

### Day 3-4: Post First 9 to Instagram Grid

Post 3 per day for 3 days to fill the grid. This way your profile looks established before you start promoting. Nobody follows an account with 1 post.

### Day 5-7: Start Engaging

- Follow 50-100 accounts in fitness, pixel art, indie gaming niches
- Start the Power Hour habit: 30 min/day commenting on posts in these communities
- Post 2-3 Stories per day (polls, behind-the-scenes)
- Do NOT promote yet — just build presence

---

## Week 2: Soft Launch — Start the Engine

### Instagram (post 5x this week)
- 3 Reels + 2 carousels
- Focus on the evolution mechanic — make people curious about what Phase 3 and 4 look like
- Every caption ends with a question: "What phase would you be at?" / "How many steps do you walk daily?"
- Daily Stories with polls and engagement stickers

### TikTok (post daily — 7 videos)
- Cross-post your Reels BUT also create TikTok-native content
- **The TikTok play:** Film yourself walking with the Live Activity visible. Voice over: "I built an app where a pixel character lives on my Lock Screen and evolves as I walk." This "I built" format crushes on TikTok.
- Use trending sounds — search "chill walk" or "lo-fi" for audio
- Post at different times to test what works

### Reddit (plant seeds — DO NOT spam)
- **r/PixelArt** — Post your character sprite sheet as pixel art. Title: "Evolution stages of a character I designed for a fitness app." Don't hard-sell, let people ask about the app in comments.
- **r/iOSProgramming** — Post about a technical challenge: "Implementing Live Activities with pixel art animation in SwiftUI." Mention the app naturally.
- Comment genuinely on 5-10 posts per day in r/fitness, r/walking, r/Apple, r/IndieGaming
- **Do not post app links yet.** Build karma and credibility.

### X/Twitter
- Post your first #buildinpublic thread: "I just launched Pixel Pace — a step tracker where your pixel character evolves as you walk. Here's the 6-month journey of building it as a solo dev." Include screenshots, GIFs, App Store link.
- Engage with 10+ indie devs per day

---

## Weeks 4-5: Retention Push — Keep Users Walking

Downloads mean nothing if people delete the app after Day 1. This is where you turn downloaders into subscribers.

### Content Strategy Shift: Show the Journey
- Post Reels of YOUR pixel pal evolving over the week: "Day 1 vs Day 7"
- Share your own step counts and evolution progress
- Create FOMO around Phase 3 and 4: tease the character art without fully revealing it
- "My pixel pal just hit Phase 3 — only premium users can see this"

### Encourage UGC
- "Show me your Lock Screen" call-to-action on every post
- Feature any user who shares a screenshot (DM them too — "love your pal!")
- Launch #PixelPaceFriday — every Friday, users share their weekly step count and pixel pal

### Push Notifications (in-app)
- If users haven't opened the app in 2 days: "Your pixel pal misses you! Come check on them."
- When they hit evolution thresholds: "Your pal is about to evolve!"
- These drive retention, which drives paywall hits

### Instagram + TikTok: Premium Tease Content
- "Phase 3 character reveal" Reel — show the premium evolution looking incredible
- "Things only premium Pixel Pace users know" carousel
- "Is the subscription worth it? Here's what you unlock" (transparent, not pushy)
- Side-by-side: Free (Phase 1-2) vs Premium (Phase 3-4) character designs

**This is where subscriptions start coming in.** Users who've been walking all week see Phase 2, hit the paywall, and the premium phases look amazing because you've been teasing them on social.

## Weeks 6-8: Scale What's Working

- Even a 10% response rate = 2-3 organic posts reaching 10K-50K people

### First Giveaway

## The Subscription Conversion Playbook

Getting downloads is step 1. Here's how to maximize the free → paid conversion:

### In-App Tactics
1. **Show premium characters early** — In the app, display Phase 3 and 4 characters with a lock icon. Let users SEE what they're missing.
2. **Paywall timing is key** — Currently triggers at Phase 2. This is good — the user is invested by then.
3. **Free trial** — Consider offering 7-day free trial of premium. Users who experience Phase 3/4 are much more likely to pay.
4. **Annual plan emphasis** — Show the annual plan ($19.99/yr) prominently alongside monthly ($2.99/mo). The savings angle: "Save 44% with annual."

### Content That Drives Subscriptions
- Every "Phase 3/4 reveal" Reel drives curiosity → downloads → walking → paywall → subscription
- "Is Pixel Pace Premium worth it?" honest review-style content builds trust
- User testimonials: "This app actually made me walk 10K steps a day"
- Comparison content: "Free vs Premium — what you get"

### Pricing Psychology
- $2.99/mo is an impulse price — less than a coffee
- $19.99/yr is the "smart choice" — 44% savings, whole year
- Frame as: "Less than $1.70/month to evolve your pal to Legendary"

## Download Targets by Week

| Week | Cumulative Downloads | Primary Drivers |
|------|---------------------|-----------------|
| 1 | 0 (pre-launch) | Building content foundation |
| 2 | 20-50 | Soft launch, organic discovery |
| 3 | 200-500 | Hard launch blitz (PH + Reddit + all channels) |
| 4 | 350-650 | Sustained posting + word of mouth |
| 5 | 450-750 | Retention content + UGC starts |
| 6 | 550-850 | Influencer campaign begins |
| 7 | 700-950 | Giveaway + press outreach |
| 8 | 1,000+ | Compounding effects + Apple feature nomination |

**Subscription target:** 3-5% conversion rate is realistic for a well-designed freemium app.
- 1,000 downloads × 4% = 40 subscribers
- 40 × $2.99/mo = ~$120/mo revenue (or higher with annual plans)
- This compounds — every month adds more users to the funnel

## Budget Summary

| Item | Cost | When |
|------|------|------|
| Platform accounts | Free | Week 1 |
| Content creation (Canva Pro) | $13/mo | Week 1 |
| Linktree Pro (optional) | Free tier | Week 1 |
| Micro-influencer codes | Free (premium codes) | Week 6 |
| Giveaway prize | Free (premium sub) | Week 7 |
| Paid Reel boost (optional) | $50-100 | Week 8 (boost best Reel only) |

## Priority Actions — Do These First

1. **Create TikTok and Reddit accounts TODAY**
2. **Batch-create 12 Instagram posts this weekend**
3. **Film one "I built this app" TikTok** — this single video could outperform everything else
4. **Start the Power Hour engagement habit** — 30 min/day, every day
5. **Schedule your Product Hunt launch** for Week 3
6. **Build a "Share My Pixel Pal" feature into the app** — this is your viral loop (can do post-launch)

---

## What I Can Help Build

- **In-app share card generator** — branded shareable image when users hit milestones
- **Push notification system** — retention nudges for inactive users
- **Free trial implementation** — 7-day premium trial for new users
- **Onboarding optimization** — make the first-run experience stickier
- **A/B test paywall copy** — test different messaging on the paywall screen
- **App Store screenshot designs** — optimized for conversion

Say the word and I'll start building any of these.

*This plan assumes organic-first growth. If you want to add paid ads later (Instagram/TikTok ads), that's a separate strategy — but get to 1,000 organic downloads first to validate product-market fit before spending money on ads.*
