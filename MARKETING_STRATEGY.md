## Part 1: Immediate Action Items (This Week)

### 1.1 App Store Optimization Fixes

**Current State Analysis:**
- Title: "Pixel Pace" (10 chars) — UNDERUTILIZED (30 chars available)
- Description: Good messaging, but could be stronger
- Keywords: Unknown (check App Store Connect)
- Screenshots: Need optimization
- Size: 2.2 MB — Excellent (fast download)

**Recommended Title Change:**
```
Current:  Pixel Pace
Proposed: Pixel Pace - Step Companion
```
This adds searchable keywords while maintaining brand identity.

**Recommended Subtitle (30 chars):**
```
Living Lock Screen Buddy
```
or
```
Guilt-Free Step Tracker
```

**Keyword Field Optimization (100 chars, comma-separated, no spaces):**
```
pedometer,walking,steps,fitness,health,dynamic,island,widget,tracker,daily,goals,pixel,companion
```

**Description Rewrite (First 3 lines are critical):**
```
Your steps deserve a friend, not a judge.

### 1.2 Screenshot Optimization

Create 10 screenshots showing:

2. **Lock Screen** — Show Lock Screen widget in action
3. **Character Selection** — Gender selection during onboarding
4. **Evolution Phases** — Show all 4 phases side by side
5. **No Guilt Messaging** — "Low energy? Your pal rests with you"
6. **Privacy Badge** — "Zero data collected" with lock icon
7. **Dynamic Island Expanded** — Full expanded view
8. **Home Screen Widget** — Widget on home screen
9. **Before/After** — Regular step app vs Pixel Pace messaging
10. **Social Proof** — Reviews/testimonials (add later)

**Screenshot Text Guidelines:**
- Large, readable text (minimum 60pt)
- High contrast colors
- Show actual app UI, not mockups
- Include device frame

### 1.3 App Preview Video (30 seconds)

**Storyboard:**
```
0-3s:  Hook — "Tired of step apps that judge you?"
3-8s:  Problem — Show typical step counter with big red numbers
8-12s: Solution — Introduce Pixel Pace character
12-18s: Demo — Show Dynamic Island, Lock Screen, evolution
18-25s: Benefit — "Movement without guilt"

Instead of screaming "YOU ONLY WALKED 2000 STEPS", your little buddy just looks tired. And when you're active, they're energetic.

Key features:
- Lives in Dynamic Island & Lock Screen
- No obsessive step counting
- Character evolves over time
- Zero data collection

It's free with no ads. Would love feedback from the community.

Hey Product Hunt!

I'm Akram, and I built Pixel Pace because I was tired of fitness apps making me feel bad about myself.

The concept is simple: instead of showing you aggressive step counts, a tiny pixel character lives on your Lock Screen. When you're active, they're energetic. When you're not, they're just... tired.

No guilt. No judgment. Just a little buddy.

Key features:
- Dynamic Island + Lock Screen presence
- 4 evolution phases as you build consistency
- Male/female character options
- Zero data collection

Would love your feedback!

## Part 3: Retention & Engagement

### 3.1 Push Notification Strategy

**When to Ask for Permission:**
- After completing first 3-day streak
- After first evolution milestone
- NOT during onboarding

**Notification Types:**

| Type | Timing | Example |
|------|--------|---------|
| Streak at risk | 8 PM if no steps | "Your buddy is getting sleepy. Quick walk?" |
| Milestone | On achievement | "Your companion evolved to Phase 2!" |
| Weekly summary | Sunday 7 PM | "Great week! Your pal is feeling energetic." |
| Re-engagement | After 3 days inactive | "Your pixel buddy misses you..." |

**Rules:**
- Max 1 notification per day
- Never guilt-based ("You failed!")
- Always character-focused messaging
- Easy opt-out

### 3.2 Review Request Strategy

**Optimal Timing:**
- After 7-day streak achieved
- After first evolution (Phase 2)
- After user taps "Refresh" 10 times (engaged user)

**Never Ask:**
- During onboarding
- After low-step days
- When app just launched

**Pre-Prompt Strategy:**
Show in-app message first:
```
"Enjoying your pixel buddy?

[Love it!] [Could be better]"
```
- "Love it" → Show Apple review prompt
- "Could be better" → Show feedback form

### 3.3 Feature Roadmap for Retention

**Short-term (1-3 months):**
- [ ] Streak tracking with visual calendar
- [ ] More character customization (outfits, colors)
- [ ] Weekly summary reports
- [ ] Share milestone images to social

**Medium-term (3-6 months):**
